This is a landing page concept I designed for a sports platform. The idea was to create a modern, dynamic hub for sports fans, where they can explore categories, read the latest news, and check live scores — all in one place.

Bakcground and Approach: Sports platforms are usually cluttered with too much information. My goal here was to simplify the experience, keeping it bold, clean, and visually engaging while still delivering real-time value.

Design Workflow:

- Inspiration: Looked at leading sports news and streaming sites to understand user expectations.
- Wireframing: Sketched a simple structure with a strong hero section, quick access to sports categories, and a highlight section for live scores.
- UI Design: Dark theme for a sleek, modern look, red highlights for CTAs and key actions to grab attention, bold typography for clarity and hierarchy.

Key Features:

- Hero Section with tagline + CTA to immediately engage users.

- Sports Categories (Tennis, Cricket, Baseball) presented with image cards for quick navigation.

- Latest News Section styled with a bold block for prominence.

- Live Scores Widget for football and cricket, making the page feel interactive and “alive.”
